# **Programming Practice**
This repository demonstrates my ability to solve problems using a variety of programming languages. 

There are 5 problems in total:
1. In Chrome/Safari/Opera, *make sure* you reload your web mail page before trying to use Markdown Here.
2. In Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Opera, log into your Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo account and start a new email. In Thunderbird, start a new message.
3. Make sure you're using the rich editor.
   * In Gmail, click the "Rich formatting" link, if it's visible.
   * In Thunderbird, make sure "Compose messages in HTML format" is enabled in your "Account Settings", "Composition & Addressing" pane.
4. Compose an email in Markdown. For example:


1. Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a given list using a for-loop, a while-loop, and recursion
2. Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements. 
3. For example: given the two lists [a, b, c] and [1, 2, 3], the function should return [a, 1, b, 2, c, 3]
3. Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. As an example, here are the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34
4. Write a function that given a list of non negative integers, arranges them such that they form the largest possible number. For example, given [50, 2, 1, 9], the largest formed number is 95021
5 Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 (in this order) such that the result is always 100. For example: 1 + 2 + 34 – 5 + 67 – 8 + 9 = 100


The problems will be solved using the following programming languages:
- Java
- Python
- C
- PHP
